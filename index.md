Hello! My name is Bobby. I currently work at UConn in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences as a lab manager for the HELLO Lab. I graduated from Wesleyan University with a double major in Neuroscience & Behavior and Italian Studies with a minor in Informatics & Modeling. 

I am a bit of a jack of all trades! I am particularly interested in language, the natural world, and learning new skills. In my free time, I like to play video games (currently: Balatro), bake, crochet, and garden. In the future, I would like to create digital tools to help others feel the same curiosity and satisfaction when learning.
