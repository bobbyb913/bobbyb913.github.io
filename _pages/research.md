## "Toy Preferences of Toddlers" Project
**Poster presentation at the [International Conference on Development & Learning 2024](https://la.utexas.edu/users/dil/ICDL_Austin_2024/)**

### Overview
I began this project to learn more about how the children who participated in our study on language learning at UConn interacted with the toys when playing with their parents. Based on previous work, I expected that it might have implications for language learning. First, I needed to develop a question to see if the children were playing with the toys differently from each other at all. \
\
As the project took shape, I thought it would be a good fit for ICDL which had a focus on play-based learning. I submitted it as a poster presetation and it was accepted. I attended in May of 2024 to present my work.\
\
This project was taken up independently as my contribution to the lab's desire to analyze the collected data in as many ways as possible. I think that the future directions are relevant to researchers interested in play-based learning and professionals who work with children who are D/deaf or hard of hearing. I would work on the project in addition to my day-to-day responsibilities as lab manager.

### Abstract

#### Background
Children benefit from playful learning for which parent-child interactions play an important role. Typically, a child’s sustained attention on an object during an interaction provides an opportunity for an adult to name the object and the child to learn the word. Curiosity, interest, and intrinsic motivation determine which objects children attend to; thus, they are driving forces of that learning. Further, the toys chosen affect the type, complexity, and diversity of play. In fact, various factors can contribute to observable differences in how children play; interestingly, hearing experience and associated language development have been observed as factors that determine how a child plays with their parents and how they play with their peers. Since toddlers who are D/deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) and use cochlear implants (CIs) and/or hearing aids show language delays compared to their typically hearing peers, learning more about the association of hearing experience and interest in different toys can help inform early interventionists that work in the homes of toddlers who are DHH. 
#### Aims
Using head-mounted eye tracking and frame-by-frame analysis, we examined how children distribute bouts of exploration on each toy and how long those bouts tend to be. The preference for certain toys, or lack thereof, described by more frequent looks at a toy and/or longer duration of looks of children who are typically hearing and children who are DHH could inform preference for types of play in each group. Discrepancies can be further investigated to learn if sensory differences are related to how the children play with the toys. 
#### Methods
Head-mounted eye trackers were worn by children (30 ± 3 months) and their caregiver. The dyad was instructed to play with ten toys (four plastic figurines, three tools, two foam toys, and one tambourine) as they normally would at home for ten minutes. Data were collected and calibrated from moments when the experimenter was not in the room and both participants had usable eye tracking data. Frame-by-frame annotation described what each dyad member was looking at and holding with either hand at every frame at a rate of 30 Hz. From the child’s point of view, a count of every sustained look at an object and every sustained look at an object in their hands was tallied and the duration was extracted. The number of looks (logarithmically transformed) and duration of looks per toy were compared using mixed-model linear regressions. 
#### Results
Overall, hearing experience was a marginal explanatory variable in toy preference, explaining 6.6% of the variance of the number of sustained looks in hand and 4.4% of the variance of duration of sustained looks in hand. For sustained looks at the toys in hand, both groups of children on average held and looked at the dolphin toy for a shorter duration; children who are DHH held and looked at the radish toy for a shorter duration; and children who are DHH looked and held the dolphin toy and sloth toy less frequently. For sustained looks in general, both groups of children on average looked at the camel toy and dolphin toy for a shorter duration. 
#### Conclusion
A child’s hearing experience was marginally associated with toy preference in a parent-child free play setting. However, the model did not provide strong enough evidence to conclude that hearing experience alone could explain variance in toy preference. It is likely that the multimodal nature of parent-child interaction led to the decreased ability to isolate the influence of hearing experience. As a next step, behavioral coding could provide evidence to cluster toys into categories of those used similarly (e.g., plastic toys, tools, etc.) to decrease the number of categories and increase counts within them to see if they better explain the variance between groups. Additionally, redefining the interest variable as the frequency of play over time (e.g., playing with the dolphin toy throughout the play session instead of all at once) could better isolate curiosity about a toy from attentiveness to it.

### Credits
I created the research questions, toy interest behavioral coding scheme, data processing scripts, and poster with mentorship from Dr. Derek Houston at the University of Connecticut. The data analysis plan and script were made with the assistance of Statistical Consulting Services at UConn. The eye gaze coding and hand-touch coding were completed by me and other research assistants at the University of Connecticut, The Ohio State University, and the University of Texas - Austin.
