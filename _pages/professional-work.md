## UConn HELLO Lab Website

**[hellolab.speech-language-hearing.uconn.edu](https://hellolab.speech-language-hearing.uconn.edu/)**

### Overview
I designed the website for the research lab I have been employed by since June of 2023, the Hearing Experience and Language Learning Outcomes (HELLO) Lab. Before starting, I had meetings with the principal investigator, Dr. Derek Houston, and research scientist, Dr. Torri Ann Woodruff-Gautherin, to discuss their vision for the site. It was important to them that the site is built for parents and community organizations. They wanted a focus on professionalism, equity, approachability, and altruism since we work with families who have children that are D/deaf and hard of hearing and might be hesitant to join research studies.\

Based on the discussions, I gave the site a unique identity compared to other UConn labs, included many photos, showed our community initiatives, and made our research easy to access. Since the lab was founded in 2023, I was excited to think of the best ways to share our activities with the new community. This was my first time designing a website, so it was an interesting challenge. I had to comply with UConn brand standards and the functionality allowed by UConnâ€™s WordPress service, Aurora. Under these restrictions, I used custom CSS and HTML to supplement the modules and plugins provided by Aurora. The site is being updated regularly. Behind the scenes, I have provided documentation to future lab managers on how to maintain the website.
