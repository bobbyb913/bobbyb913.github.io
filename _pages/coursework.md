## “Exploring the genetic basis of second language learning: A systematic review”

**Final project for [PSYC335](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&facid=NONE&crse=016514&term=1231)**

### Overview

We were assigned to pick a behavior of interest and write a review on the behavior genetic research that existed about it. I decided to write mine on second language learning because my other coursework has covered themes of second language learning and pedagogy. I found that the topic had a small group of disconnected studies, so a review would be a unique scientific contribution.

## "The physiology and psychology of medieval love"

**Final project for [ITAL227](https://owaprod-pub.wesleyan.edu/reg/!wesmaps_page.html?stuid=&facid=NONE&crse=014558&term=1231)**

### Overview

We were assigned to investigate any topic that would connect various medival texts about love. Additionally, our professor encouraged us to make interdisciplinary connections. As a neuroscience major, I decided to compare a commentary by a medieval doctor, Dino del Garbo, on the etiology and symptomology of love described by Italian poet, Guido Cavalcanti, with research in modern neuroscience. The text is in Italian. To summarize, the terminology used by the medieval scholars is outdated, but they did observe physiological reactions to love, like flushed cheeks for example, that continue to be studied today and are now better understood and described. \

Even though it is in Italian, I think it's a neat interdisciplinary project I wanted to show off!
