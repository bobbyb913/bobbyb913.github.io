# WILD Wes
**Working for Intelligent Landscape Design at Wesleyan University**

Below, you'll find a gallery of some of my best time spent in college: working at our permaculture site. I worked over the summer, and was proud of how much me and my peers were able to accomplish. I always liked gardening and was excited to learn a new school of thought about sustainable landscaping and moving away from monocultures, which are especially present on college campuses. The site was founded in 2012 but faced major loss in involvement which reach its lowest during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a team, we raised our email list to 70 students and hosted multiple events in the site over the summer to raise student awareness.
